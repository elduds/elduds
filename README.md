[![Email](https://img.shields.io/badge/luke%40lukedudney.com-%2330B980.svg?logo=minutemailer&logoColor=white)](mailto:luke@lukedudney.com)  [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%23003A9B.svg?logo=inspire&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukedudney/)

I'm Luke -- a systems, infrastructure, cloud and devops engineer with over 25 years experience in IT across various industries including Mining, Professional Services, ISP/Telco, Media, Broadcasting and Publishing.

For the past 10 years I have pursued my current passion for IT automation, infrastructure architecture and AWS public cloud technologies. Prior to that I focussed on enterprise datacentre and internet platforms such as servers, storage, VMware vSphere virtualisation, load balancing, fabric, networking and security.

Currently I am the lead AWS Cloud and High Performance Compute Platform subject matter expert for an [ASX 10](https://www.commsec.com.au/education/under-30s/Stock-up/Australias_10_largest_stocks.html) global mining and green energy company, supporting business activity with yearly revenues of c. 20 billion USD, 8 digit yearly cloud spend, and the development of an compelling & amazing roadmap of green energy technologies and capabilities.
