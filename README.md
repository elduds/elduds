## Hi there üëã
I'm Luke -- a systems, infrastructure, cloud and DevOps engineer with over 25 years experience in IT across industries including Mining, Professional Services, ISP/Telco, Media, Broadcasting and Publishing.

For the past 10 years I have pursued my current passion for IT automation, Linux systems engineering, infrastructure architecture and AWS public cloud technologies. 

Currently I am the lead AWS Cloud and High Performance Compute Platform subject matter expert for an [ASX 10](https://www.commsec.com.au/education/under-30s/Stock-up/Australias_10_largest_stocks.html) global mining and green energy company, supporting yearly business activity of c. 30 billion USD, 8 digit yearly cloud spend, and the development of a compelling & amazing roadmap of green energy technologies and capabilities.

Prior to that I focussed on enterprise datacentre and internet platforms such as servers, storage, VMware vSphere virtualisation, load balancing, fabric, networking and security.

## Studies
* Bachelor of Science (Computer Science), incomplete
* Bachelor of Science (Physics), incomplete

Straight out of high school in 1998 I completed two semesters of an undergraduate double degree in computer science and physics, my two intellectual catnips. The tiny regional internet service provider [WestNet](https://www.westnet.com.au/) I was casually working for at the time offered me a promotion and the opportunity to build and manage an Australia-wide communications network and the supporting server infrastructure needed to support the business plan. Over the next 8 years I helped to scale the business 4000x from 10,000 to 400,000 customers which satisified my intellectual cravings for using smart technology to deliver outstanding customer and business outcomes.
